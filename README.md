# BloomBounty Staking Pool

Welcome to the **BloomBounty Staking Pool**! This document provides an overview of how the staking mechanism works, the rewards distribution, and how you can participate as an investor or farmer.

## 🚀 Project Overview

**BloomBounty** is a decentralized platform designed to tokenize real-world agricultural assets. It connects farmers with global investors through a staking mechanism that ensures mutual growth and profitability.

## 🌱 Key Features
- **Staking Pools:** Investors stake their funds in pools that support agricultural projects.
- **Dual Rewards:** Earn returns in both $SUI and BloomBounty tokens ($BLB).
- **Revenue Distribution:** Transparent revenue-sharing model benefiting all stakeholders.

## 🔗 How It Works
1. **Farmers Register:** Farmers register their agricultural projects on BloomBounty.
2. **Investors Stake:** Investors choose a pool and stake $SUI tokens.
3. **Earn Dual Rewards:** Investors receive $BLB tokens representing their stake and earn ROI in both $SUI and $BLOOM.
4. **Revenue Distribution:** After crop sales, revenue is distributed:
   - 50% to investors (in $SUI)
   - 10% to the community
   - 10% to farmers
   - 30% for project development

## 📈 Return on Investment (ROI)
ROI is calculated based on:
- **Staked Amount:** The more you stake, the higher your share of the profits.
- **Pool Performance:** Each pool’s ROI depends on the agricultural project's success.
- **Dual Rewards:** Investors receive both $SUI and $BLOOM, increasing potential returns.

## 🔒 Security
- Smart contracts ensure transparent and secure transactions.
- Funds are locked during the staking period to prevent misuse.

## 💼 Getting Started
1. **Connect Wallet:** Use a compatible wallet to connect to BloomBounty dapp.
2. **Stake $SUI:** Choose an investment pool and stake your tokens.
3. **Track Earnings:** Monitor your rewards in real-time via the dashboard.
